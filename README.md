# PathFinding_BFS

This is a visualization path finding algorithm which uses BFS. As such, it considers a grid with nxn nodes in it, where every node is connected to all the adjecent node( it can be varied from 4 to 8). It avoids obstacles in the path and finds the shortest path between the source and destination.
